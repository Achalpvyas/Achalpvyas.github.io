      <p>Graph theory is the field of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs which are mathematical structures used to model relationships between objects. A Graph is represented by a set of vertices and the edges connecting these vertices. The true essence of the graph theory is its flexibility with 
         which it can be used to model a wide variety of problems. A Graph is used in the domain of computer science to model communication networks, data strucures, computer organizations and flow of computations
         in the field of sociology to measure actors' prestige or to explore rumor spreading and in the field of <b>Robotics</b> to model multi robotics problem and task allocation problems. The Travelling Salesman Problem is an optimization problem and it can be used using the techniques applied to solve the problems
         in graphs. Matching Algorithms are an important class of graph theory algorithms which are used to find matchings in a graph. The goal in the matching problem for a graph G is to find a matching containing as many edges as possible, that is, a maximum cardinality subset of the edges such that each vertex is adjacent to at most one edge of the subset.
         <br>In multi robot applications, robots and the task space are modelled as a graph and a matching algorithm is used to allot the specific task to the robot.</p>
    
      <h3>Summary of the topic in layman’s terms</h3>
      <p>Blossom Algorithm is a matchmaking algorithm used to produce a maximum matching on any graph. It was created by Jack Edmunds in 1961.
          It has applications in a wide variety of fields of Robotics, Operations Theory, Biology, Mathematics etc. In this article, we will focus our attention on the applications in the domain of Robotics and Decision Making for Robotics.
          A matching is a graph that occurs when all vertices are connected to at most one other vertex through a single edge.
          A maximum matching occurs when the number of edges in the matching graph is maximized. Before we dive deeper into the intrinsics of the algorithm. First we will discuss, what is graph theory and its basic elements - <br>
          <br><b>Graph theory:</b> is the field of mathematics that deals with mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects.</br><br><b>Graph:</b>A Graph G is an ordered pair of disjoint sets G = (V, E) where E = VxV. Set V is called the vertex or the node set and Set E is called the edge set of graph G.

      <h3>Formal definition using appropriate notation</h3>
      <p>Consider an undirected unweighted graph <b>G(V, E)</b>, where <b>V</b> and <b>E</b> are the set of vertices and the set of edges respectively. Let <b>M</b> denote the numbers of matchings in the graph <b>G</b></p>

      <center><h3>Given a graph G and a matching M, M is a maximum matching if and only if there exists no M-augmenting path.</h3></center>
      <h3>Overview of the key results</h3>
      
      <h3>Discussion of how the topic relates to decision-making for robotics</h3>
      <p>There are many applications of Blossom Algorithm in a wide variety of fields including Robotics. In Robotics, blossom Algorithm is used in Multi Robot applications. s. The task
      planning problem is posed as a maximum-weighted matching of a bipartite graph, the solution of which using the blossom algorithm allows each robot to autonomously identify the optimal
      sequence of tasks it should undertake.</p>
