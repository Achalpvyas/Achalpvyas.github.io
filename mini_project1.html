      <h3><br>Summary of the topic in layman’s terms</h3>
      <p>Blossom Algorithm also known as the Edmunds Algorithm is a matchmaking algorithm. It's an algorithm in graph theory which can be extensively applied to multi agent robotics systems. The pivotal result obtained from this algorithm is maximum matchings can be found out in polynomial time.
       </p>
      <h3>Formal definition using appropriate notation</h3>
      <p>Consider an undirected unweighted graph <b>G(V, E)</b>, where <b>V</b> and <b>E</b> are the set of vertices and the set of edges respectively. Let <b>M</b> denote the numbers of matchings in the graph <b>G</b></p>

      <h3>Overview of the key results</h3>
      
      <h3>Discussion of how the topic relates to decision-making for robotics</h3>
      <p>There are many applications of Blossom Algorithm in a wide variety of fields including Robotics. In Robotics, blossom Algorithm is used in Multi Robot applications. s. The task
      planning problem is posed as a maximum-weighted matching of a bipartite graph, the solution of which using the blossom algorithm allows each robot to autonomously identify the optimal
      sequence of tasks it should undertake.</p>
