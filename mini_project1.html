      <h3>Summary of the topic in layman’s terms</h3>
      <p>Blossom Algorithm is a matchmaking algorithm used to produce a maximum matching on any graph. It was created by Jack Edmunds in 1961.
          It has applications in a wide variety of fields of Robotics, Operations Theory, Biology, Mathematics etc. In this article, we will focus our attention on the applications in the domain of Robotics and Decision Making for Robotics.
          A matching is a graph that occurs when all vertices are connected to at most one other vertex through a single edge.
          A maximum matching occurs when the number of edges in the matching graph is maximized. 
      <br>Before we dive deeper into the intrinsics of the algorithm. First we will discuss, what is graph theory and its basic elements -</br>
      <br><br><b>Graph theory:</b> is the field of mathematics that deals with mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects.</br> 
      <br><b>Graph:</b>A Graph G is an ordered pair of disjoint sets G = (V, E) where E => VxV. Set V is called the vertex or the node set and Set E is called the edge set of graph G.</br>
      <br><b>Vertex:</b>A fundamental unit with which a graph is constructed.</br>
      <br><b>Edges:</b>The objects which connect the vertices to form a graph.</br>
      <br><b>Path:</b>A path is a sequence of vertices traversed using edges.</br>
      <br>A Graph is represented by a set of vertices and the edges connecting these vertices. The true essence of the graph theory is its flexibility with 
         which it can be used to model a wide variety of problems. A Graph is used in the domain of computer science to model communication networks, data strucures, computer organizations and flow of computations
         in the field of sociology to measure actors' prestige or to explore rumor spreading and in the field of <b>Robotics</b> to model multi robotics problem and task allocation problems. The Travelling Salesman Problem is an optimization problem and it can be used using the techniques applied to solve the problems
         in graphs. In multi robot applications, robots and the task space are modelled as a graph and a matching algorithm is used to allot the specific task to the robot.

      <h3>Formal definition using appropriate notation</h3>
      <p>Consider an undirected unweighted graph <b>G(V, E)</b>, where <b>V</b> and <b>E</b> are the set of vertices and the set of edges respectively. Let <b>M</b> denote the numbers of matchings in the graph <b>G</b></p>
      <center><img src="img/algorithm.png" alt="from references"></center>
      <p>Given a graph G and a matching M, M is a maximum matching if and only if there exists no M-augmenting path.</p>
      
      <h3>Overview of the key results</h3>
      
      <h3>Discussion of how the topic relates to decision-making for robotics</h3>
      <p>One of the important research areas in Robotics where the Blossom Algorithm has been applied extensively is the task allocation problem. In multi robot task allocation application,
      the task planning problem can be fomulated as the maximum weighted matching of a bipartite graph. This problem can be solved using the Blossom' algorithm. This helps the multi agent system to autonomously identify 
      the sequence of tasks it should undertake.</p>
