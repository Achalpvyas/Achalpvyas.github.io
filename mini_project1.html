      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Blossom Algorithm is a matchmaking algorithm used to produce a maximum matching on any graph. It was created by Jack Edmunds in 1961.
          It has applications in a wide variety of fields of Robotics, Operations Theory, Biology, Mathematics etc. In this article, we will focus our attention on the applications in the domain of Robotics and Decision Making for Robotics.
          A matching is a graph that occurs when all vertices are connected to at most one other vertex through a single edge.
          A maximum matching occurs when the number of edges in the matching graph is maximized. 
      <br>Before we dive deeper into the intrinsics of the algorithm. First we will discuss, what is graph theory and its basic elements -</br>
      <br><br><b>Graph theory:</b> is the field of mathematics that deals with mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects.</br> 
      <br><b>Graph:</b>A Graph G is an ordered pair of disjoint sets G = (V, E) where E => VxV. Set V is called the vertex or the node set and Set E is called the edge set of graph G.</br>
      <br><b>Vertex:</b>A fundamental unit with which a graph is constructed.</br>
      <br><b>Edges:</b>The objects which connect the vertices to form a graph.</br>
      <br><b>Path:</b>A path is a sequence of vertices traversed using edges.</br>
      <br>A Graph is represented by a set of vertices and the edges connecting these vertices. The true essence of the graph theory is its flexibility with 
         which it can be used to model a wide variety of problems. A Graph is used in the domain of computer science to model communication networks, data strucures, computer organizations and flow of computations
         in the field of sociology to measure actors' prestige or to explore rumor spreading and in the field of <b>Robotics</b> to model multi robotics problem and task allocation problems. The Travelling Salesman Problem is an optimization problem and it can be used using the techniques applied to solve the problems
         in graphs. In multi robot applications, robots and the task space are modelled as a graph and a matching algorithm is used to allot the specific task to the robot.

      <h3>Visualizing the Algorithm</h3>
      <p>The visualization of the algorithm is produced using TU Munich' Edmond's Blossom Algorithm Visualizer [7]</p>
      <center><img src="img/blossom.gif" alt="source: TUM Blossom Algorithm"></center>
      <p>Consider an undirected graph G as shown in the graphic.</p>
      
        <ol>
          <li>First it is checked that Unmatched vertices(yellow) exists</li>
          <li>An open vertex is selected as the assigned as the root vertex(red) for the initialization of the Breadth First Search</li>
          <li>Continuing BFS with the next nodes starting from the root node and also assigning it as the active node</li>
          <li>The neighbouring nodes are checked and if the node is unmatched, it is taken in the matched graph M</li>
          <li>An augmenting path is Reconstructed as shown in orange</li>
          <li>Thus the improved matching is thereby obtained.</li>
          <li>Again a check is made in the graph for the other Free vertices</li>
          <li>The open vertex is selected and Breadth-First Search is initialized again</li>
          <li>BFS algorithm is continued and the tree is grown to that free node</li>
          <li>Checking the next neighbours</li>
          <li>Once a loop is found out in the graph it is contracted to a single blosson node</li>
          <li>Continue BFS with the next node</li>
          <li>Check the next neighbours</li>
          <li>Reconstruction of the Augmenting Path</li>
          <li>Improved Matching obtained</li>
        </ol>
      
    
      <h3>Formal definition using appropriate notation</h3>
      <p>Consider an undirected unweighted graph <b>G(V, E)</b>, where <b>V</b> and <b>E</b> are the set of vertices and the set of edges respectively. Let <b>M</b> denote the numbers of matchings in the graph <b>G</b></p>
      <center><img src="img/algorithm.png" alt="from references"></center>
      <p>Given a graph G and a matching M, M is a maximum matching if and only if there exists no M-augmenting path.</p>
      
      <h3>Overview of the key results</h3>
      
      <h3>Discussion of how the topic relates to decision-making for robotics</h3>
      <p>One of the important research areas in Robotics where the Blossom Algorithm has been applied extensively is the task allocation problem.</p>
        
      <p>From [1], Consider n robots colored black and m tasks colored gray as shown in the figure. The task allocation problem here can be defined as a bipartite(bigraphs) which are used to study and analyse the robot-task relationships.
      A Bipartite graph is the one in which the certices can be deivided into two sets such that no two vertices of the same set can be connected by a common edge. The definition of the bipartite graph perfectly explains the scenario here
       when we have two separate sets one for the robots and other for the tasks and as no two robots be related to each other but robot and tasks. The edges between the robots and the tasks are weighted in order to avoid the random allocation of
      the tasks to the robots. </p>
      <center><img src="img/graph.png" alt="from research paper DEC Mata"></center>
      <p>Once the weighted bipartite graph is produced, based on the weights of the edges a matching graph M is constructed which gives the optimized solution.</p>
      <center><img src="img/example.png" alt="source: from research paper"></center>
      <p>In electronic circuit design applications, the end effector of the manipulators need to design the path such that the vertical motion of the manipulator is minimum. In that case the problem can be formulated as a euclidean path planning algorithm and then the 
      Edmund`s Blossom Algorithm can be used to find the optimal path</p>

      <h3>Other Applications</h3>
      <p>Apart from the Robotics Applications such as Task Allocation and Target Tracking. Blossom' Algorithms is used in the solution of combinatorical problems such as the Hall' Marriage Problem and the path problem such as the Hamiltonian Path Problems.<p>      
      <p>The Hamilonian Path [13] is a traversal of a finite graph that touches each edge exactly once.</p>
      <p>The Blossom algorithm finds an optimal solution to any instance to the Eucledian Matching problem which is prominent in Combinatorial Optimization.
        The Euclidean Matching problem is formulated as given a set of vertices V in a euclidean plane, find a set of lines such that each vertex is the end of exactly one line, and such that the sum of the length of the lines is minimized.</p>
